Thanks again for the help :)
If you get sick of it, don't feel obliged to carry on helping. 
Feel free to modify this file, add bits w/e.

Todo:
 - Meets really need a town/city location. Adding a 'is venue' flag is a little confusing
  - This should autocomplete. Get list of towns in the UK, but allow to add new. Autocomplete but editable?
 - When adding a meet in a town/city, suggest venues?
 - I guess front end, when pushing stuff through sockets, should really use angular. 
 - Look into signalr integration with castle windsor. Injecting services into them would be awesome.
 - TESTS. I know you can't be fucked, but just fucking do them.
 - User input validation, get some swearing blocked.  This is a professional website, for professional people.
